# Wakey
Wakey is an Android app created for an university Android course that uses Geofencing to let users know when they're about to arrive at a certain location. No more missing that bus stop because you were sleeping or distracted on you phone!

## Why is this relevant?
{% Justificativa & concorrentes %}
"This has been done before" you might be saying, and yes, Google Maps has a similar feature built-in in their "Navigation" feature whenever the selected transportation method is Public transportation or Walking. But Google Maps is a bloated application, with too many features, not really friendly to lower-tier or old devices, and also not commonly used during daily commute. Our goal is to create develop an application for those people, being a low-impact, and not requiring too many phone resources, since showing the way and help navigating the city is not our aim, but simply help people whom want to focus on other activities while commuting.
